            Nothing drives me more than the pursuit of knowledge. As I age, I find my desire to learn only grows
            stronger. About a year age, I decided to let my thirst for knowledge lead me where it would. I soon found
            myself immersed in the world of coding. The more I studied, the more I recognized the perfect path coding is
            for someone so driven by learning because, as I am discovering each day, there is always something new just
            around the corner. I invite you to have a look at by resume here or download it here.

                    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
                    <p>
                      Bootstrap was a new framework for me. I had trouble getting my head around the grid system in the
                      beginning. Bootstrap can be very limiting, so adjusting small details or style choices felt almost
                      impossible.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <p>
                      Bootstrap is a tool that I will make use of in certain situations. Bootstrap could save a lot of
                      time on projects that don't require a lot of intricate customization. Personally, I still enjoy
                      writing my own Sass.

                    <p>
                      HTML forms are quite robust, requiring many attributes and labels. It was important to make sure
                      that everything was connected correctly. Additionally, inputs are not as easy to style as other
                      elements. It took a lot of research to find out what parts of inputs can be styled. I attempted to
                      use a neumorphism approach to the styling. It was both challenging and rewarding, but I'm sure
                      that I can refactor the design to be even more dynamic. I plan to add validation to this form
                      using JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <p>
                      I am still actively studying form elements and styling. I want to make sure forms I create in the
                      future are accessible and use proper markup. In addition, while styling this form, I realized that
                      user experience and accessibility must be prioritized. It was a great learning experience and a
                      fun project.

                    <p>
                      This was my first attempt at using an API, using promises made it a lot easier. The biggest
                      speedbump came when trying to wrap my head around pulling information from the API. Once I started
                      thinking in terms of objects, it made more sense. I also ran into some trouble when creating the
                      search function because I didn't fully understand the difference between static and live html
                      lists. Now that I have a better understanding of these lists, I'll run into fewer issues in the
                      future.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <p>
                      Almost immediately after working on this project, I started to think of other tasks that I could
                      use APIs to complete. There is something appealing to me about pulling data out of collections of
                      objects. I am particularly interested in the practices of consolidation, efficiency, and using the
                      right tool for the job. I think APIs offer a great way to hit those key areas.

                    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
                    <p>
                      There were two main challenges with this project. The first was understanding how to properly use
                      libraries, plugins, and modules. I had some initial trouble getting the baguettebox plugin working
                      becuase I wasn't sure how the plugin interacted with my own code. The project file structure
                      needed some adjusting on my end. After learning that a plugin really is just that, it all made
                      sense. The second challenge was creating the search function from scratch. It took some research,
                      but I eventually found a tutorial that made sense. This was one of the first in-depth JavaScript
                      projects I attemtped. Having learned more about DOM traversal, search functions are now easier to
                      understand and implement.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <p>
                      This project showed me that plugins and libraries are powerful, useful tools. Since completing
                      this project, I have implemented several into other projects. However, while still learning, I'd
                      like to use vanilla JS as much as possible.

                    <p>
                      This was the most JavaScript heavy project I tackled in the beginning of my coding journey. The
                      main obstacle I encountered was grasping how objects interact with one another. Trying to keep the
                      relationships of the objects straight lead to some frustrating moments. I also had a couple of
                      issues with the file structure. Up to this point, I had been working with a single JS file that I
                      could peruse with ease when needed. This project expanded the file tree. However, I was eventually
                      able to comprehend both of these aspects.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <p>
                      Object oriented JavaScript is a diverse and powerful tool. Much of the structure belies just how
                      flexible JavaScript truly is. I enjoy working with objects and arrays, so I find this kind of
                      programming particularly rewarding.

                    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
                    <p>
                      React is an incredible framework. As a new developer, the myriad challenges posed by React were a
                      bit overwhelming. I've gone through this tutorial several times to reinforce the concepts. The
                      main challenge for me was understanding how to properly structure a React application. I know this
                      will improve with more practice, as of right now, it’s still challenging. The syntax and component
                      interaction were confusing for me, but are becoming clearer each time I build with React. Another
                      minor issue was making sure my file structure was correct, especially since I wanted to deploy
                      through Github pages. Fortunately, plenty of documentation exists about how to deploy on Github
                      pages.

                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <p>
                      React will be my go-to frontend development tool. Although it’s a tad to understand, the theory
                      behind it makes sense to me. I like that React is built around breaking things down to their base
                      components. Modular components, are easier to manipulate and improve over time. I find React
                      really enjoyabe to work with for these reasons.
